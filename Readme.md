> **Question 1**
## Write about any difficult problem that you solved. (According to us difficult - is something which 90% of people would have only 10% probability in getting a similarly good solution). 

#### According to me, YouTube Video Report will be the difficult problem i have solved.

In this, We are generating a complete Video Analysis Report for Educational YouTube Video.

I have worked this project with Django and python with technologies like Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing.

# **YouTube Vid-Kit**
> **Integrated Application for Educational YouTube Video Complete Report Making**

## **Objectives**
> * To display complete video details to client based on his input.
> * To display scene detected images of the client video.
> * To perform and show Some Text Analytics along with POS & NER for the video link provided.
> * Application working from Django Server for better Interaction of the client.

## **Introduction**
> * Nowadays, analyzing unstructured data is a difficult task. Obtaining more information from unstructured data is usually beneficial in gaining insight.
> * Video is a complex data structure to analyze, and putting all of the information about a video in one place will always be tough.
> * The next most significant data structure to understand and gain relevant insight to evaluate is audio and raw text.
> * The project's overall goal is to explore numerous useful features of the video simply by sharing a link.
> * This might encompass extracting various video details, audio extraction, text extraction, text analysis, NER specification, creating a video summary, model fine-tuning, scene detection, and producing a PDF report on the full video just from a single video link.

## **Applications**
> * Find out everything there is to know about a video just through a link.
> * Obtaining useful information from unstructured data such as videos in a 
short period of time.
> * In a matter of seconds, you will get a summary of the entire video.
> * The several NER tags and pos tags used in the video are identified.
> * Interactive VIsualizations and dashboards of the Video data.
> * In just a few minutes, you'll get a complete report analysis of the video.

> **Question 2**

## **Formally, a vector space V' is a subspace of a vector space V if
V' is a vector space
every element of V′ is also an element of V.
Note that ordered pairs of real numbers (a,b) a,b∈R form a vector space V. Which of the following is a subspace of V?**
> * The set of pairs (a, a + 1) for all real a
> * The set of pairs (a, b) for all real a ≥ b
> * The set of pairs (a, 2a) for all real a
> * The set of pairs (a, b) for all non-negative real a,b

#### The set of pairs (a, b) for all non-negative real a,b 

> * For all Non Negative Real numbers a and b, there exists in supspace of vector space V
